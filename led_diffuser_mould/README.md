Make your own LED diffuser for the Stealhburner. 

## Instructions
Print it, clamp it, and squirt in some hot glue ;)

Make sure you coat the inside with some sort of mould release.
I used vegetable oil from the kitchen.

There are slots to fit a flat head to help pry it apart and reveal the translucent wonder.
Clean up the flash and clip off the spru where the glue was inserted
