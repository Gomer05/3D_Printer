**:warning: Testing for nozzle-scrub mount is not complete, use at your own risk.**

This allows a nozzle-scrub to be mounted on the Switchwire. This provides the ability to do nozzle probing, and take take advantage of [auto z calibration](https://github.com/protoloft/klipper_z_calibration). I use this in combination with [:arrow_right: z-stop](/z-stop/)

### Notes
- This is modeled after the [Decontaminator](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/abandoned_mods/printer_mods/edwardyeeks/Decontaminator_Purge_Bucket_%26_Nozzle_Scrubber) Props to the creator! (edwardyeeks I believe...)
- The brush mount here is a copy of 'Decontaminator', just trimmed down to fit the Switchwire
- Even the purge bucket is inspired by the 'Decontaminator'

**:warning: Only Enderwire conversions are supported at this time**

**:warning: Requires holes to be drilled in your Y Carriage**

## What else is needed
- TODO

## BOM
- M3 bolts 16mmx2, 6mmx2

## Instructions
- You will need to align the mount on the under side of the bed, as illustrated for your printer. There are registration features to align the mount properly.
- Mark and drill the holes once the mount is aligned.
- A zip-tie hole is included to assist with wire management.
