All these tests were only performed once. No averages taken.

The ambient temperature was around 70F for each test.

I'm running [Darkdogs ender 3 conversion](https://github.com/boubounokefalos/Ender_SW ) Rev1, with modifications of my own. 
These tests are using that encloser's dimensions. I am using thicker plexiglass (6mm) and wood panels instead of coriplast. I also added some 'insulation' to some areas.

I added a nevermore to the back of the enclosure, it blows across the top of the chamber, towards the doors

All tests used a macro to set the same bed (105C) and hotend (115C) and to 'park' the bed and hotend in the center. I took the final measurement whenever "I felt like" the temerapure stopped climing. Typically if I didn't see an upward trend over about 20 minutes, I called the test and moved on. 

Each test took about an hour or so to run.

I wanted to share these results for a couple reasons, but mostly so I can test other's ideas too. So, let me know if you have a fan position you want to test!
